## Getting Help

Post your questions in [Piazza]( http://piazza.com/university_of_montreal/fall2019/ift6758) and hopefully your peers will answer.  Note that in Piazza questions are visible to everyone.

Exclusively in the event that you have a question of a sensitive, personal nature: Please feel free to email the instructors. Please start the subject of your email with “[IFT6758]” to make sure that it is not lost.
